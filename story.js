        "The morning of January 1968, Johnny Cash gave two live performances for the inmates at Folsom Prison. The recordings from those shows were released to critical acclaim later that year as the album <a href='https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4TJIdlY9hGSSTO1kUs1neh'><i>At Folsom Prison</i></a>. Cash's hand-written liner-notes describes the unique atmosphere of this record: <i>\"Listen closely to this album and you hear in the background the clanging of the doors, the shrill of the whistle, the shout of the men -- even laughter from men who had forgetten how to laugh\"</i>.",
        "One moment that had always stood out to me was immediately after <i>Cocaine Blues</i>. The warden interrupted the performance for an official announcement : <i>\"These men have receptions: Matlock A50632 and Batchelder A39879\"</i>. These two inmates were pulled out of a concert would become one of the <a href='https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-200-best-albums-of-the-1960s/?page=8'>greatest albums</a> <a href='https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/johnny-cash-at-folsom-prison-152260/'>of all time</a> because they happened to get visitors at that moment.",
        "I was curious who these men were, so I sent FOIA requests across the state of California to see what I could discover. Eventually, I received copied of prison records for James Wesley Matlock (A50632) and Jack Batchelder (A39879). Below I walk summarize their experience with the penal system, as told through prison records."

        "There's not really a conclusion to draw here other than the fact that Matlock and Batchelder were real men in Folsom Prison, and not set-dressing to give the album a sense of authenticity. It's easy to notice parallels between their experiences and the lyrics of <i>At Folsom Prison</i>, but I'll leave that speculation up to you.",
