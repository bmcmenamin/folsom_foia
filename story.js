        "In January 1968, Johnny Cash recorded two live performances given for inmates at Folsom Prison. Those recordings were released as the album <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_Folsom_Prison'><i>At Folsom Prison</i></a> to critical acclaim later that year. The acclaim was, in part, due to the unique atmosphere of the album. According to Cash's hand-written liner notes: <i>\"Listen closely to this album and you hear in the background the clanging of the doors, the shrill of the whistle, the shout of the men -- even laughter from men who had forgetten how to laugh\"</i>.",
        "One of those background moments that stands out is when the warden interrupts the performance for an official announcement immediately after <i>Cocaine Blues</i>: <i>\"These men have receptions: Matlock A50632 and Batchelder A39879.\"</i>. These two men -- Matlock and Batchelder -- were pulled out of a concert that would go on to become one of the <a href='https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-200-best-albums-of-the-1960s/?page=8'>greatest albums</a> <a href='https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/johnny-cash-at-folsom-prison-152260/'>of all time</a>. I had always wanted to know more -- Who were these guys? Who were their vistiors?",
        "I sent FOIA requests to California, and eventually I was mailed the prison records for James Wesley Matlock (A50632) and Jack Batchelder (A39879). Below I summarize their experience with Folsom Prison by walking through their prison records."

        "There's not really a conclusion to draw here other than the fact that Matlock and Batchelder were real men in Folsom Prison, and not set-dressing to give the album a sense of authenticity like some of the <a href='https://www.denverpost.com/2008/12/10/a-cash-secret-unlocked/'>other crowd noise</a>. It's easy to notice parallels between their lives and Cash's lyrics, but I don't want to start speculating too much about men I've only known through reproductions of water-damaged government records.",
        "If you'd like a copy of their records, here are some links so you don't have to file a FOIA request:"
